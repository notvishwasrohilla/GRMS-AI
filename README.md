# GRMS AI

## Vision
The goal of this project is to create a Chrome extension that can scan questions on a webpage and use AI to provide answers. This project will help me learn how to build Chrome extensions and integrate AI models for practical use cases.

## Learning Journey
This repo will serve as a **learning tracker**. As I progress through building this project, I'll document the steps I take and the challenges I face.

## Current Focus
- Setting up the basic structure for the Chrome extension.
- Learning how to use content scripts to extract data from webpages.
- Planning the integration of AI for answering questions.
